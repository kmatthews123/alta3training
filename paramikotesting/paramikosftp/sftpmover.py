    # and then creates stream tunnels, called channels, across the session. 
    t = paramiko.Transport("10.10.2.3", 22) # IP and port

    # "How to connect (see other labs on using id_rsa private/public keypairs)" - Negotiate an SSH2 session, and optionally verify the serverâ€™s host key
    # and authenticate using a password or private key. This is a shortcut for start_client, get_remote_server_key, and Transport.auth_password
    # or Transport.auth_publickey. Use those methods if you want more control.
    #
    # You can use this method immediately after creating a Transport to negotiate encryption with a server. If it fails, an exception will be thrown.
    # On success, the method will return cleanly, and an encrypted session exists.
