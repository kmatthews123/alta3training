   Moving files with SFTP
   
the recommended way of completing this challenge script is to do the following
#!/usr/bin/python3 
#Alta3 Research | rzfeeser@alta3.com
#Use Paramiko to create an SFTP session and transport files into a directory determined by the user

# python3 -m pip install paramiko
import paramiko # allows Python to ssh


# standard library
import os # low level operating system commands
import getpass # we need this to accept passwords


def transfer_to_this_remote_dir():
    #ask user for full path of directory to be created
    while True:
        what_dir = input("What directory on the remote host would you like to transfer files to (default: /tmp/)? ")
        if what_dir == "":   # if they just hit "enter" we can assume they want the default
            what_dir = "/tmp/"
            break  # escape the infinite loop
        elif what_dir[0] == "/" and what_dir[-1] == "/":
            break  # escape the infinite loop
        print("You must enter a full path for the remote host. Full paths must begin and end with '/'.")
    return what_dir  # this should be a full path


def movethemfiles(sftp):
    #a simple function that moves files across an SFTP paramiko channel
    what_dir = transfer_to_this_remote_dir()  # nested function call to determine the full path to transfer to

    # iterate across the files within directory
    for x in os.listdir("/home/student/filestocopy/"): # iterate on directory contents
      if not os.path.isdir("/home/student/filestocopy/"+x): # filter everything that is NOT a directory
        sftp.put("/home/student/filestocopy/"+x, what_dir+x) # sftp.put("from_path_local", "to_path_remote") - move file to target location
    return

def main():
    #runtime
    ## where to connect to
    t = paramiko.Transport("10.10.2.3", 22) ## IP and port of bender

    ## how to connect (see other labs on using id_rsa private / public keypairs)
    t.connect(username="bender", password=getpass.getpass()) # notice the password references getpass

    ## Make an SFTP connection object
    sftp = paramiko.SFTPClient.from_transport(t)

    # call function that moves files
    movethemfiles(sftp)  # we must pass the sftp connection channel to the function

    ## close the connection
    sftp.close() # close the sftp connection
    t.close()    # close the transport channel

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

The ways in which my solution differ are that I dont create an independant function for main and the move the files command
this would have been good practice but I wanted to figure out if I could do everything this way.
If I was to make a function to actualy move these files around with their own function...
we would nest the portion of main that is the for loop into its own function
we would pass the varible sftp into the function for the sftp connection details
we would also put the what_dir = transfer_to_remote_dir() in the move files function
this would have the main function call the move files function call which would call the transfer_to_remote_dir function

    # and authenticate using a password or private key. This is a shortcut for start_client, get_remote_server_key, and Transport.auth_password
    # or Transport.auth_publickey. Use those methods if you want more control.
